## Information We Collect

We may collect certain information when you use our Service:

This data helps us understand how users interact with our Service and to improve its functionality and user experience. We strive to minimize the collection of personally identifiable information.

## Use of Cookies and Tracking Technologies

As mentioned above, third-party services like analytics and advertising partners may use cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies to collect information about your browsing activities over time and across different websites. You can typically manage cookie preferences through your browser settings.

*   **For Legal Reasons:** We may disclose information if required by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities.

## Data Security

We take reasonable measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. However, no internet transmission is ever completely secure or error-free.

## Children's Privacy

Our Service is not directed to children under the age of 13 (or a higher age threshold depending on the jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
